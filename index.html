        <h2>Xylo's incoherent Yapping</h2>
        <p>ok So... I'll just go ahead and say it; I wasted a bit too much time on this. I problebly shouldn't have tried to do a page on my own stuff because I'm just gunna spend all my time doing writing and character design instead of what I set out to do which was learn some code... which I at least sorta did. In the end I had to settle for what I had cuz I spend too much time on this allready. But I will finish it! Even if it is not perfectly writen or perfectly to my liking lore wise, I need to just hurry up and finish. Anyways some stuff on the actuall... stuff: I gave Radish that name because some Radishes have yellow flowers and I figured that Edward being the one who named him or at least gave him an English name; was a huge nerd. I couldn't get Ezra's armor to look good in the software I was using so I gave up. Really none of their clothes look good. But I do like the texturing of their bodys even if it was all a massive waste of time. I like how Edward's head kinda looks like Jupiter and how Edmund looks like dereto dust however you spell that. also Love Felix's... everything and how I was able to astablish their realation ship with Ezra in just a 2 sentances and some longwinded titles. Also I LOVED doing the faces. even though it was the hardest part. also I realize that Edmund's face.... looks like a furry's.... Idk why... It's problebly the eyes... and the mischievousness... or idk, however you would describe that look. Also the Bodyguard position is really more like care taker/servant. Welp even if this was a huge waste of time at least I develop these characters a bit and made designs for em.... in a software I'll problebly never use for character stuff ever again... 눈_눈 <br>©️ Xylo Vozik</p>
